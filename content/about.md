Kids Free Typing Games is a collection of short, playful typing activities designed for very young learners (roughly ages **2–6**).

## What makes it different
- **Free to play** — no sign‑ups required.
- **Mobile friendly** — big targets, touch keyboard support, and short rounds.
- **Typing first** — letter practice, simple words, and confidence-building feedback.
- **Kid-safe vibes** — calm pacing, positive reinforcement, and clear instructions.

## Tips for parents and teachers
- Start with one game and keep sessions short (1–3 minutes).
- Say the letter or word out loud first, then type together.
- Celebrate effort, not speed.
